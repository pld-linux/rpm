- rpm.macros: don't add -s to LDFLAGS in %%configure if LDFLAGS!=""
  (needed for not stripping ld.so during build)
- patch to (buggy) installplatform script
- removed brp-strip patch (it does nothing - ld.so is shared object, which
  brp-strip doesn't strip)
- db1 buildreq is _without_static-dependent
- release 11
